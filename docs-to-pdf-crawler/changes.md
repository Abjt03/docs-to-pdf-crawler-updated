# Changes Required for docs-crawler.js

## File Location
`docs-crawler.js`

## Existing Code (lines 377-385)
```javascript
async run() {
    console.log('ðŸš€ Starting documentation crawler...\n');
    
    await this.init();
    await this.crawlAndGeneratePDFs();
    await this.mergePDFs();
    
    console.log('\nâœ¨ Process completed!');
}
```

## Changes to be Made
1. Remove the line: `await this.mergePDFs();`
2. Replace the final completion message with:
```javascript
    console.log('\nâœ¨ Process completed without merging and cleanup!');
    console.log(`ðŸ“„ Individual PDFs are in: ${this.outputDir}`);
```

## Reason
The user requested two modifications:
1. Skip PDF merging (remove the call to `mergePDFs()`)
2. Skip temp file cleanup (automatically skipped since merging is removed)
3. Provide information about where temporary PDFs are stored

This change will:
- Preserve individual PDFs in the temp directory
- Skip the merging process entirely
- Skip the cleanup process
- Provide clear feedback to the user about the output location
